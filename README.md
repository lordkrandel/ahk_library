What
------------------------

An [AHK_L](http://l.autohotkey.net/] "Autohotkey_L" stand-alone library with no external dependancy



Why
------------------------

This is my personal Object-Oriented library I use for AHK_L development.
AHK_L has Object Oriented design, but very few object are included in the core.
